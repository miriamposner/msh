#Maori Subject Headings

These files are drawn from the [Ngā Upoko Tukutuku/Maori Subject Headings](https://natlib.govt.nz/nga-upoko-tukutuku) prepared by [Te Whakakaokao, the Ngā Upoko Tukutuku Reo Māori Working Group](https://natlib.govt.nz/about-us/friends-and-advisors/te-whakakaokao). They were originally encoded as MARC and MARCXML files but have been converted into CSVs to make them easier to work with.
